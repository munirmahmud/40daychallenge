## Day 18–20: Mental Health Focus

- **Physical:** Add high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to your routine. This can be done with simple exercises like jumping jacks, burpees, and high knees.

- **Mental Health:** Practice gratitude journaling (write 3 things you’re grateful for every morning or night). Incorporate 5 minutes of breathing exercises before bed.

- **Confidence:** Celebrate small wins. For example, "Today I added 5 more push-ups than last week," or "I’m noticing more energy throughout the day."
