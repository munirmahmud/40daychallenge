# Day 4–6: Nutrition and Mindful Eating

- **Physical:** Increase workout intensity slightly (e.g., 20-30 minute full-body workout). Add a walk in the park.

- **Mental Health:** Incorporate 5 minutes of mindfulness or deep breathing after each workout.

- **Habit Building:** Start tracking your meals. Focus on eating whole, nutritious foods. Try to include more vegetables, fruits, and lean protein in your diet.

- **Confidence:** Do a self-assessment—write down one thing you like about yourself and one area you want to improve.
