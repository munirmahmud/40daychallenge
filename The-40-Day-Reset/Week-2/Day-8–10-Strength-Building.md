## Day 8â€“10: Strength Building

- **Physical:** Start adding bodyweight exercises for strength (e.g., lunges, push-ups, squats, and planks). Gradually increase the intensity or duration of each exercise. Aim for 30 minutes per session.

- **Mental Health:** Continue mindfulness, and add 5 minutes of positive affirmations after workouts.

- **Habit Building:** Focus on consistency. Try to wake up and exercise at the same time each day. Make your workout a non-negotiable part of your routine.
