## Day 11â€“13: Outdoor Park Workouts

- **Physical:** Take your workout to the park. Use free outdoor equipment (pull-up bars, benches, etc.) for strength training. Incorporate different movements like step-ups, bench dips, or using a pull-up bar.

- **Mental Health:** Continue mindfulness practices and start using journaling for emotional expression (how you feel during the workout and after).

- **Confidence:** Start visualizing your end goal. Imagine yourself after 40 days, and try to bring that sense of accomplishment into your workouts.
